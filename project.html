        <p>
            The general topic we intend to cover is dream recording. Because of the seemingly random content dreams can have, ranging from pleasant, surreal, or terrifying, many people often enjoy sharing their dreams with others or trying to find patterns and meanings within them. The problem is that people very often forget their dreams after a short period of time. Naturally, this makes it very difficult for people to share their dreams or try to remember them. As a result, people often try to find many different ways to record their dreams before they fade away from memory, such as physically writing down their dreams or typing them into an online document.

                One interactive feature that we intend to have is a way for users to create an entry where they can write down their dreams. This feature will include a title for the entry, a space to write down the contents of their dream, and ways to attach “tags” and emotions that relate to the dream for easy access and organization.
            </li>

                Another interactive feature that we intend to have is the ability to search and filter out specific entries based on things such as date, title, tags, or emotions. This is to allow users to be able to quickly access dreams that they had written down by their core elements.
            </li>
            <li>
                The third interactive feature we intend to have is the ability to “connect” dreams together. When trying to find patterns between dreams or suspecting that different dreams could be related, the ability to be able to connect them together like a conspiracy cork board would be a very helpful tool.
            </li>

                One pretty important feature to have is to make everything locked behind a password. Dreams can sometimes be very intimate and personal, containing things that people wouldn’t like others to know about.
