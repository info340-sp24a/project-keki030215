    <h1>Project Proposal: Dream Journal</h1>

    <!--Problem/Data Domain Section-->

        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        
        <h3>Overview of The General Topic</h3>
        <p>
            The general topic we intend to cover is dream recording. Because of the seemingly random content dreams can have, ranging from pleasant, surreal, or terrifying, many people often enjoy sharing their dreams with others or trying to find patterns and meanings within them. The problem is that people very often forget their dreams after a short period of time. Naturally, this makes it very difficult for people to share their dreams or try to remember them. As a result, people often try to find many different ways to record their dreams before they fade away from memory, such as physically writing down their dreams or typing them into an online document.
        </p>

        <h3>Information technology problem</h3>
        <p>
            The information technology problem here is that people who want to record their dreams for various reasons, for example, seeing a therapist document what happened in their subconscious or just talking about their dreams and sharing them with other people, do not have an appropriate method and solution to record their dreams. On the other hand, recording dreams can be difficult for people since, usually, it is very common to forget what happened in our dreams after waking up, and therefore a simple solution is required to solve this problem.

    <!--App Description-->

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        
        <h3>Users of The Application</h3>
        <p>
            The users of the application will be those who are interested in exploring their dream content, or even categorizing their dreams for more detailed records, and who have to document their dreams for medical reasons, like seeing what is in their subconsciousness. Every individual who is interested in the topic will have access to the app. This app might help those who have mental health issues to better explore themselves and improve their talking with therapists since it can provide more details about their dreams. 
        </p>

        <h3>Interactive Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                One interactive feature that we intend to have is a way for users to create an entry where they can write down their dreams. This feature will include a title for the entry, a space to write down the contents of their dream, and ways to attach “tags” and emotions that relate to the dream for easy access and organization.
            </li>
            <li>
                Another interactive feature that we intend to have is the ability to search and filter out specific entries based on things such as date, title, tags, or emotions. This is to allow users to be able to quickly access dreams that they had written down by their core elements.
            </li>
            <li>
                The third interactive feature we intend to have is the ability to “connect” dreams together. When trying to find patterns between dreams or suspecting that different dreams could be related, the ability to be able to connect them together like a conspiracy cork board would be a very helpful tool.
            </li>
            <li>
                One pretty important feature to have is to make everything locked behind a password. Dreams can sometimes be very intimate and personal, containing things that people wouldn’t like others to know about.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Information The Users Be Viewing</h3>
        <p>
            The information that users will be viewing will be their dream records that are allowed for uploading and downloading, the dreams of other people who would like to share, different types of dreams, and their thoughts on their dreams. This information will be mainly textual. At the current stage, we do not have an external source yet.
